  # BtoBetUITesting üìù  
  This project is for automated UI browser tests using Playwright with Cucumber BDD, TypeScript, and Page Object Model (POM) patther is a robust and maintainable framework designed for automating end-to-end browser tests in a behavior-driven development (BDD) style. This project leverages the power of Playwright, a modern and cross-browser automation framework, combined with Cucumber for test specification, TypeScript for strong typing, and the Page Object Model pattern for organized and reusable test code.

This command will execute the tests using Playwright, generate HTML reports in the reports directory, and create JUnit XML reports in the reports directory. Screenshots for failing test cases will be captured in the screenshots directory.

## Code Quality ‚öôÔ∏è

This project includes Husky, ESLint, and Prettier for code quality and linting.

Husky is set up to run pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality.
ESLint is configured to enforce coding standards and identify issues in your TypeScript code.
Prettier is used for code formatting to maintain consistent code style.


## Reporting üìä

#### Reports can be found in the `out` directory.
- HTML reports are located in the reports directory.
- JUnit reports are also available in the reports directory.
- Screenshots for failing test cases are stored in the screenshots directory.
- Videos can be found in the videos directory when the `PWVIDEO` environment variable is set to true.
